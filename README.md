# Schur functions in noncommuting variables

Several objects appear in different branches of mathematics. One of these objects is the family of symmetric functions. A symmetric function is a bounded-degree formal power series that is invariant under the permutation of its variables. Schur functions, which are identical to irreducible representations of symmetric groups, form an important basis of the space of symmetric functions.
Schur functions, despite their name, were introduced by Jacobi in 1841, and their appearance in the representation theory of symmetric groups and general linear groups was discovered by Schur more than half a century later. Jacobi expressed $s_\lambda$ in terms of the h-basis using an identity often called the Jacobi-Trudi identity.

$$s_\lambda = det(h_{λ_i−i+j})_{1≤i,j≤l(λ)} ~~(\text{Jacobi-Trudi identity})$$

In addition to representation theory, Schur functions have many connections to combinatorics, probability theory, algebraic geometry, geometric complexity theory, et cetera.
Symmetric functions in noncommuting variables, NCSym, were introduced in 1936 by Wolf. Bergman and Cohn generalized Wolf’s work in 1969 but there were few further discoveries until 2004 when Rosas and Sagan essentially developed the theory and gave noncommutative analogues of classical concepts in symmetric function theory, such as the RSK map and the ω involution. Since then much of the algebraic structure of NCSym has been revealed, but the central open problem of Rosas and Sagan, of whether there is a way to define Schur functions indexed by set partitions having properties analogous to the classical Schur functions, remained. Here we program the candidate for Schur functions in noncommuting variables presented in [1].
